B) Onward to Insight! 

1. Assess birth rate trends: We can estimate the number of newborns per state per year. This is done in Hive and 
   outputted into a csv file, Birth_Trends.csv.

   I then used Python to plot a line graph of the birth rates of New York, California, Pennsylvania, Florida, and
   Massachusetts from 1910 till 2014. The code for creating the plots is in plotting.py. The plot is in BirthRate.png.

2. The website Behind the Name (http://www.behindthename.com) has information on the origins of names around the world
   I wrote a simple webscraper using BeautifulSoup to extract the origins of each name and writes the data out to a
   file NameOrigins.csv for further processing. The webscraper is implemented in names_scraper.py.

   I then loaded the output data NameOrigins.txt into Hive and created a table consisting of each state (plus DC), each 
   year since 1910, and the total number of newborn with names of a given origin that registered for SSN in that state
   during that year. We may be able to glean some ancestral connection and religious affiliation within each state, 
   immigration patterns across states, and other denominational information through this study. The table is given in file
   Origins_By_State.csv.

   I then loaded the data into Python and select a subset of the data, namely those for the state of California 
   between 2010 and 2014, with a origin count of at least 8,000. I plotted a bar chart to illustrate the portion of
   the name origins over the period 2010 and 2014, it's in CA_Origins.png. 

   Some other ideas along these lines: Using the etymological and historical of the names available on the site, we can
   create a recommender system for baby names, we may also be able to detect some fundamental cultural shifts.
