A) Descriptive analysis

   I used Hive on Cloudera Hadoop CDH 5 for this part.

1. The data files (except for StateReadMe.pdf) are comma-delimited cvs/text files (with a TXT extension).
   The data files are also collated by state.

   One distortion of the data is pointed out in StateReadMe.pdf. For privacy reasons, the names that are used
   fewer than 5 times per state, year, and gender are not included in the files. This means the total count of all names
   is less than the total count of these names across the United States. So the answers to 2, 3, 4, and 5 may not be actually
   correct even though they are correct from the data given.

   Another distortion is the files are in ASCII format. So non-English alphabets/characters such as accented characters 
   are not included. (Using Unicode can address this.)

   Also names longer than 15 characters are not represented.

2. For part 2, we load all the TXT data (in '/home/cloudera/Documents/CapitalOne/', after removing StateReadMe.pdf) 
   into a Hive table [babynames] (Ref: http://wise.ajou.ac.kr/mata/load-csv-file-to-hive-hadoop/)

    hive> CREATE TABLE babynames (state STRING, sex STRING, year INT, name STRING, freq INT) \
          ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' STORED AS TEXTFILE;
    hive> LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/cloudera/Documents/CapitalOne/' INTO TABLE babynames
   
   We can then query for the most popular name of all time:

    hive> SELECT name, SUM(freq) AS cnt FROM babynames GROUP BY name ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 10;

  ANSWER: This shows that the most popular name of either gender is "James", which has been used 4957166 times.

3. For part 3, we first create two views [g] and [b] that contains the total number of each girl/boy's name 
   across all states in each given year. 

    hive> CREATE VIEW g AS SELECT name, year, SUM(freq) AS freq FROM babynames WHERE sex='F' GROUP BY name, year;
    hive> CREATE VIEW b AS SELECT name, year, SUM(freq) AS freq FROM babynames WHERE sex='M' GROUP BY name, year;

   Then, for the years 2013 and 1945, we look for the names whose difference in count between boys and girls are the least, 
   and if there are multiple minimums, we sort them by the total count of the names in descending order

    hive> SELECT g.name, ABS(b.freq-g.freq) AS offset, b.freq+g.freq AS total FROM g INNER JOIN b ON \
          g.name=b.name AND g.year=b.year WHERE g.year=2013 ORDER BY offset ASC, total DESC LIMIT 10
    hive> SELECT g.name, ABS(b.freq-g.freq) AS offset, b.freq+g.freq AS total FROM g INNER JOIN b ON \
          g.name=b.name AND g.year=b.year WHERE g.year=1945 ORDER BY offset ASC, total DESC LIMIT 10

   ANSWER: The most gender ambiguous name in 2013 is "Nikita", which is used a total of 94 times for 47 boys and 47 girls.
           The most gender ambiguous name in 1945 is "Maxie", which is used a total of 38 times, for 19 boys and 19 girls.
           (Runner up for 1945: "Artie", used a total of 45 times, 22 times for boys and 23 times for girls.) 

4. For part 4, we use the following formula to assess percentage change in popularity of a given name since 1980:

   ([total occurrence for years > 1980] - [total occurrences for years <= 1980])/[total occurrences for years <= 1980]

   We also need to check for names that are never used on or before 1980, but are used after 1980 and vice versa.

   We implement this in Hive as follows:

    hive> CREATE VIEW tally AS SELECT name, year, SUM(freq) AS freq FROM babynames GROUP BY name, year; 
    hive> SELECT t.name, SUM(t.freq) AS cnt FROM tally t WHERE t.year>1980 AND t.name NOT IN (SELECT s.name FROM
          tally s WHERE s.year<=1980) GROUP by t.name ORDER BY cnt DESC limit 10;
    hive> SELECT t.name, SUM(t.freq) AS cnt FROM tally t WHERE t.year<=1980 AND t.name NOT IN (SELECT s.name FROM
          tally s WHERE s.year>1980) GROUP by t.name ORDER BY cnt DESC limit 10;
    hive> CREATE TABLE pop_perc AS SELECT s.name, (t.cnt-s.cnt)/s.cnt AS ratio FROM (SELECT name, SUM(freq) AS cnt 
          FROM tally WHERE year>1980 GROUP BY name) t INNER JOIN (SELECT name, SUM(freq) AS cnt FROM tally WHERE year<=1980
          GROUP BY name) s ON t.name=s.name;
    hive> SELECT * FROM pop_perc ORDER BY ratio DESC LIMIT 10;
    hive> SELECT * FROM pop_perc ORDER BY ratio ASC LIMIT 10;

   ANSWER: There are 15409 names used after 1980 that do not occur on or before 1980. Out of these, "Jayden" has the highest
           count at 188064. The other way around, we have 5989 names that are used on or before 1980 but not since. Of these,
           "Gertrude" is the most popular and is is used 119827 times.

           Discounting these names that are never used prior to 1980, the name that has the largest percentage increase in 
           popularity since 1980 is "Makayla", which has increased by 1573866.6667%, from 6 names on or before 1980 to 94438 
           names after 1980.

           The name that has the largest percentage decrease in popularity since 1980 is "Blanche", which has decreased by
           approximately 99.98186%, from 55130 names on or before 1980 to 10 names after 1980.
   
5. The question here is a bit ambiguous and lends to interpretation. I assume it is referring to the names that either started
   or stopped getting used around 1980? In that case, I have already alluded to this in the answer to question 4. There are
   15409 names that do not appear until after 1980, and the most popular of these is "Jayden". The other way around, there
   are 5989 names that have not been used after 1980, and the most popular of these is "Gertrude", which is used 119827 times.
